# 02 · Delegate Your First Task

**Time: ~30 minutes** *(~10 min of your effort; the agent works while you watch)*

This is the heart of the workshop. You'll run the complete autonomous development loop once, end to end:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/ai-teammate-101/assets/diagram-loop.svg" alt="The delegation loop from issue to merged PR" width="780" />
</p>

> **You'll leave this page able to:** write an issue an agent can execute, assign it to Copilot, read the session log, and review + merge the resulting PR.

---

## 🎯 The task

TaskMango's filter bar (`All / Active / Completed`) tells you *which* filter you're on, but not *how many tasks* are behind each one. Your users (okay, you) want counts:

> `All (5) · Active (3) · Completed (2)`

Small. Visible. Well-defined. Perfect first delegation.

</p>

You'll trigger **assignment** in Lab 2.2, watch **autonomous development** and the **quality check** in Lab 2.3, and close the **PR & review** phase in Lab 2.4.

> **🆓 Free plan path:** instead of the GitHub.com steps below, open your copy of the repo in VS Code, open Copilot Chat in **Agent mode**, and paste the same issue text. The rest of this module — reviewing the diff, checking tests — applies the same way.

## Lab 2.1 — Write an issue an agent can execute

An autonomous agent can't ask you clarifying questions mid-flight (well — it *can*, but the round-trip costs you the whole point of delegating). **Your issue body is the spec.**

1. In **your copy** of the repo, open the **Issues** tab → **New issue**.
2. Title: `Show task counts in the filter bar`
3. Body — copy this, then read it critically before submitting:

````markdown
## User story

As a TaskMango user, I want each filter tab to show how many tasks it
contains, so I can see my workload at a glance.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The filter bar shows counts for all three filters:
      `All (n) · Active (n) · Completed (n)`
- [ ] Counts update immediately when a task is added, completed, or deleted
- [ ] Counts are computed from the full task list, not the currently
      visible (filtered) list
- [ ] A unit test covers the count logic

## Context

- The filter bar lives in `taskmango/src/components/TaskFilter.tsx`
- Task state lives in `taskmango/src/App.tsx` — you'll likely need to
  pass counts down as props
- Run tests with `npm test` from the `taskmango/` folder
````

> ⚠️ **Anti-pattern to avoid:** "make the filters better." An agent given a vague task will produce *a* change — just probably not the one you wanted. Ambiguity in, entropy out.

<details class="dive"><summary><strong>Why each part of this spec earns its place</strong></summary>

| Element | Why the agent needs it |
|---|---|
| **User story** | The *why* — helps it make judgment calls you didn't specify |
| **Acceptance criteria** | A testable definition of done — this is what it will self-check against |
| **Pointers into the codebase** | Saves the agent exploration time and prevents it from guessing file layout |
| **How to verify** | `npm test` tells it how to prove its own work |

You'll write specs like this forever after this workshop.

</details>

## Lab 2.2 — Hand it off

1. On the new issue, open the **Assignees** (⚙️gear icon) section in the right sidebar.
2. Select **Copilot**.
3. In the assignment dialog, confirm the repository and base branch (`main`) are correct, optionally choose your model, leave **Optional prompt** empty — the issue body you wrote in Lab 2.1 is the complete spec — then click **Assign**.
4. Within a few seconds, Copilot adds a **👀 reaction** to the issue. That emoji is your "ticket acknowledged."

<details class="shot"><summary>What you'll see — the "Assign agent to issue" dialog</summary>
<img class="shot" src="/ai-teammate-101/assets/shots/Assignees.gif" alt="Assign agent to issue dialog showing the optional prompt box left empty, the repository and main branch selected, and the Assign button" />

</details>

Behind the scenes, Copilot spins up a sandboxed GitHub Actions environment with your repo checked out, and starts working. You never touch this environment — you observe it.

## Lab 2.3 — Watch it think (session logs)

1. Copilot opens a **draft pull request** linked from the issue's sidebar (Development section) and timeline. If the link isn't there yet, wait ~30 seconds and refresh.
2. Open the PR. Note that it's a **draft**, and that Copilot wrote the PR description itself — including a task checklist it ticks off as it goes.
3. In the **Commits** tab you'll see an **"Initial plan"** commit at the top — this is a placeholder Copilot creates before writing any code. It has no file changes; the real diff is in the commits below it.
4. In the PR timeline, click **View session**.

</details>

<details class="shot"><summary>Where to watch — the "View session" link in the PR timeline</summary>
<img class="shot" src="/ai-teammate-101/assets/shots/m02-agents-session.png" alt="PR timeline event showing Copilot started work with a View session link" />
</details>

This is the part most people skip and shouldn't. The session log is the agent's lab notebook. As you scroll, look for:

- [ ] **Exploration** — which files did it read first? Did it find `TaskFilter.tsx` quickly, or wander?
- [ ] **Planning** — did its stated plan match your acceptance criteria *before* it wrote code?
- [ ] **Verification** — did it actually run `npm test`? Did it write the new test you asked for?
- [ ] **Recovery** — if it hit an error, how did it respond? This is where you learn whether to trust it with bigger tasks.

> 💡 **Why this matters:** trusting an agent isn't faith, it's evidence. Session logs are the evidence. Get fluent at reading them now, on a tiny task, so you can skim them later on big ones.

Copilot typically takes 3–10 minutes for a task this size. While it works, you could preview [Module 03](../03-become-the-tech-lead/README.md) — or just watch. First time, watching is half the fun.

## Lab 2.4 — Review like it came from a teammate

When Copilot finishes, it marks the PR **ready for review** and requests your review. Now do the job you hired it to do.

<details class="shot"><summary>What you'll review — the Files changed diff Copilot produced</summary>
<img class="shot" src="/ai-teammate-101/assets/shots/m02-pr-diff.png" alt="Files changed view showing edits to TaskFilter.tsx, App.tsx, and a new TaskFilter test" />
</details>

Open the **Files changed** tab and work through this rubric (you'll get a fuller version in Module 03):

| Check | Question to ask | For this PR, specifically |
|---|---|---|
| **Correctness** | Does it do what the issue said? | Counts show for all three filters? Computed from the *full* list? |
| **Fit** | Does it match how the codebase already does things? | Did it follow the existing prop-passing style, or invent a parallel pattern? |
| **Tests** | Is the new behavior covered? | Is there a real assertion on the counts, or a test that passes vacuously? |
| **Scope** | Did it touch only what the task required? | Any drive-by refactors or reformatted files you didn't ask for? |

Then leave a review — even if it's an approval:

- **If it's right:** approve, then click **Ready for review** to promote the draft. You may also see a **"7 workflows awaiting approval"** notice — click **Approve workflows to run** so CI can execute. Once both are done, **Merge pull request → Confirm merge**. You just shipped code you didn't write, through the same process you'd use for a human teammate.
- **If it's close but wrong:** leave a review comment **mentioning `@copilot`** describing what's off (e.g. "counts don't update when a task is deleted — check the delete path in App.tsx"). Copilot picks the comment up, resumes the session, and pushes new commits.

> 💡 **Try it on purpose:** even if the PR looks fine, leave one small piece of feedback — ask for a style tweak or an extra edge-case test. Watching the agent iterate on review feedback is the single most instructive part of this module.

## ✅ Checkpoint

You're done with Module 02 when:

- [ ] Your issue got a 👀 from Copilot
- [ ] A `copilot/…` branch PR appeared, moved from draft to ready-for-review
- [ ] You read the session log and found the moment it ran the tests
- [ ] You left at least one piece of review feedback and saw the agent respond
- [ ] The filter bar in your merged `main` shows live counts

<details class="dive"><summary><strong>🆘 Troubleshooting — if something's stuck, look here</strong></summary>

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Copilot doesn't appear in Assignees | Plan doesn't include coding agent, or org policy blocks it | Check [setup](../../setup/00-environment.md); org repos need the policy enabled by an admin |
| No 👀 after several minutes | Agent capacity/queue delay | Wait, or unassign/reassign; check githubstatus.com |
| PR exists but session seems stuck | The agent is rate-limited mid-session | It usually resumes on its own; check the session log's last entry |
| The change looks wrong in a way feedback didn't fix | Spec ambiguity | Close the PR, rewrite the issue with tighter acceptance criteria, reassign. Rewriting the spec is a legitimate, cheap iteration strategy |

</details>

<details class="dive"><summary><strong>💭 Reflection — three questions worth a minute each</strong></summary>

1. What did you put in the issue that the agent clearly *used*? What did it ignore?
2. Reading the session log, where did the agent's approach differ from how *you* would have done it? Was its way worse, or just different?
3. How long did the whole loop take — and how much of that was *your* time versus waiting time? What would you do with the waiting time in a real project?
